# She's in S.T.E.M.

## Motivation
### This is our entry for the 2nd Women Who Code Atlanta Hackathon.
The purpose of this project is to reach girls who come from poor communities and may not know about careers in the S.T.E.M. fields. This site gives girls the ability to research careers and also watch video interviews of women in these careers. Sometimes you need to hear a story of success from someone with a similar background to feel inspired.
